<sup> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @theshpio</sup>
<sup> ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C</sup>
<sup> :books: My library is [humble-bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books)</sup>
<sup> :writing_hand: I like to find something new in [vim](https://vimhelp.org/index.txt.html) and [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)</sup>


<sup>I am a self-taught, infrastructure-focused engineer who dreams of coding, solving complex problems, and using math to better understand the world and predict its changes with higher precision.
I am fascinated by technologies and I imagine and get sparked by ideas very often.</sup> 
<sup>
My plan here is to reflect on how quickly I can grasp the basics and start working on projects. In parallel, I am learning mathematics and becoming intrigued by [this](https://catalog.mit.edu/interdisciplinary/undergraduate-programs/degrees/computation-cognition/).</sup>
