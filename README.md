```
Dummy, scared and weak - what I always see and fight in me. 
Intelligent, brave and strong - what people think of me.

I Jump out to look for navigation. And jump back to get better in Engineering. 
I want to accept and use the freedom of creating everything I like.
I am back.

To give a pinch of what I like and think:
Dark Souls            - Reveals the Life and the gamer. Philosofy of evolution through effort to keep trying until the end.
Kingdom Come I and II - Opportunity to get experience from another life.
Fight club            - .
Pilsner Urquell       - Refreshing Honey to add another thinking aspect.
Investment            - Yet another system.
Boobs                 - Bonfire.
```
